This discrepancy in the reference timestamp led to a significantly lower value (0.18 days vs. 0.828 days). The question only asked how many days had passed since the patient’s last stay in the discharge lounge, which can reasonably be interpreted as starting from either entry or exit time, making the phrasing ambiguous. Therefore, the primary issue is ambiguity in the question or gold query, as the gold query assumes that the start of the stay (intime) should be the reference point without this being clearly stated."
